Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. 
Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

Here are some benefits of version control: 
Record of changes: VCS keeps a record of all code changes, which can be used to pinpoint when and how a bug was introduced. 
Collaboration: VCS allows teams to collaborate on a project's source code. 
Branching: VCS allows developers to work on separate streams of change, which can be merged back together later. 
Reverting changes: VCS allows users to revert changes if needed. 
Some popular VCS options include Git, Mercurial, SVN, and preforce.
